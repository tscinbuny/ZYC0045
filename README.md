# Introduction
Four-way tracking robot is an educational programmable 4WD intelligent car with easy to use and high cost performance. It is based on the UNO compatible master control "Rabbit board", using Arduino/C++ as the programming language, combined with the sensors in the package, can achieve very interesting functions. The robot has a 4-way infrared tracking module and an ultrasonic module, and users can be programmed to achieve stable tracking tasks and obstacle avoidance tasks. The driver board we used to wire up the L298N module is easy to understand, and we will provide plenty of tutorials and source code. All in all, this is a good program for programming beginners, programming education institutions, or elementary education.

This tutorial includes the file content shown in the figure below to help you learn more about the car kit and programming knowledge:

"**1_Get_start**": This folder stores the robot assembly guide and necessary software environment files, etc. In order to complete the assembly accurately and quickly, please be sure to review it in detail and assemble it according to the manual. At the same time, please review the PDF files in this folder to create the software environment correctly.

"**2_Arduino_Code**": This folder is used to store Arduino code files, upload the codes to the control board for use, each code function is independent, each time a code is uploaded, the code uploaded later will overwrite the previous code;

"**3_References**":This folder contains reference files related to the kit to help you better understand how the product works.

After completing the assembly of the car and the creation of the environment, follow this tutorial to gradually complete the program burning of the smart car and realize different functions!
